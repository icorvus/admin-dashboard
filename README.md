# Admin Dashboard
> The aim of this project was practicing my CSS Grid skills. The whole layout consists of many nested grids, no flexbox or anything similiar was used(although it would probably be easier for me to stick some flex containers here and there), just pure Grid.

## Features
- Entirely made using CSS Grid and it's fractional units.
- "Your projects" section is made responsive using auto-fit method of repeat() function
- The notification bell is animated when mouse hovers
